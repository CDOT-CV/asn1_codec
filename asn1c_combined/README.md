# doIt.sh Script
The `doIt.sh` script will copy the generated C code for the specified year into the `asn1c_combined` directory. It will also compile the example converter program.

This script expects the necessary files to have already been generated by the `generate-files.sh` script.

## Generating the C Code
The necessary files can be generated using the `generate-files.sh` script. This script will reference the necessary ASN.1 files from the `j2735-asn-files` directory from the specified year and generate the C code in the `generated-files` directory.

### Installing asn1c
The `generate-files.sh` script requires the `asn1c` compiler to be installed. The `asn1c` compiler can be installed in WSL using the following commands:

```bash
cd ./usdot-asn1c
aclocal
test -f configure || autoreconf -iv
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### J2735 ASN Files
The 'j2735-asn-files' subdirectory should contain the ASN.1 files for the J2735 standard. These are organized by year.

The `generate-files.sh` script will reference the necessary files from the `j2735-asn-files` directory when generating the C code.

#### Obtaining the J2735 ASN Files
Redistribution of the ASN files is not permitted, so they are not included in this repository. You must obtain them from SAE and place them in the `j2735-asn-files` directory under the appropriate year subdirectory.

A table of the ASN files for each year is provided below.

| Year | Source |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 2016 | https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j2735set_201603/ |
| 2020 | https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j2735set_202007/ |
| 2024 | https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j2735set_202409/ |

## Environment Variables
The `doIt.sh` and `generate-files.sh` scripts uses the following environment variables:
- `J2735_YEAR` - The year of the J2735 standard to use. For example, `2020`.

# Troubleshooting
## Fix for Makefile

The following compile flags must be set for the converter-example.c to compile (whether you need this or not is another story).

- -DPDU=<something>     // this allows the #ifndef statements in the above c file to work correctly.
- -DASN_PDU_COLLECTION  // if you have several message types you want to use.
